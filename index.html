            You know, they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe, and you can see that statement is not true! See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal, so you got a 25% at best at beating me! And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix? Your chances of winning drastic go down. See the three way, at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning. But I, I got a 66 2/3 chance of winning, cause Kurt Angle knows he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try! So, Samoa Joe, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25 percent chance, and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice! But then you take my 75 percent chance at winning, if we was to go one on one, and to add 66 2/3 chance percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice!
